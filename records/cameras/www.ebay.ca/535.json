Construction from durable , lightweight aluminum , these attachments easily fit to the front of most small-diameter lenses with a filter thread, and are themselves threaded to accept filters for further creative effects and picture control. The all-glass lens elements are fully coated to reduce reflections and flare, and will match the optical quality of today's high-performance digital cameras and camcorders. Each lens is supplied with front and rear lens caps, and soft case for protection. These lenses will fit the following filter mounts: 49mm, 52mm, 55mm, 58mm These add-on lenses work best with standard focal length lenses, such as NOTE: 18-55mm lenses included with most DSLR cameras. 2.5x Telephoto Lens: When your camera can't get you close enough to capture the action in detail, this 2.5x Telephoto lens will bring the action to you! Optically multiplying the focal length of your camera's lens by a factor of 2.5, it more than doubles your telephoto magnification and detail without any pixelization. This is dramatically better than the \"Digital Zoom\" feature of many cameras where the magnification is obtained by merely enlarging the existing image, resulting in a loss of sharpness. This 2.5x telephoto attachment is perfect for all your long-distance imaging including sports, candids, surveillance, nature and wildlife. You will also be able to utilize your camera's macro capability at over twice the usual distance , allowing for easier subject lighting with less shadows and intrusion. Normal View 2.5x Telephoto View 0.45x Wide Angle Lens: When you've run out of room, and can't possibly fit anything else into the frame, this 0.45x Wide Angle adapter will allow you to capture it all! This attachment more than doubles your camera's wide angle field-of-view . Scenic shots will be more panoramic and you'll be able to take outstanding group photos, even in tight places. In addition, the detachable Macro Lens enables you to photograph small objects up close. Great for jewelry, coins, stamps, flowers, and more. Even if your camera already has macro capability, this macro lens will get you even closer for truly amazing close-up photos. Normal View 0.45x Wide Angle View",
