Part: DMC-ZS30K Item Includes Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS30 18.1MP Digital Camera - DMW-BCM13 Lithium-Ion Battery Pack - AC Adaptor - USB Cable - Hand Strap - Software - Panasonic 1 Year Warranty Description The Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS30 18.1MP Digital Camera (Black) is a versatile, high-quality compact camera with a 20x optical zoom lens, manual exposure control, Wi-Fi connectivity and touch-control LCD screen. Its 18.1MP MOS sensor and new Venus Engine image processor provide low-noise images, accurate colors and fast performance and its 20x optical zoom lens stretches from ultra wide-angle to super-telephoto lengths for a wide range of shooting applications. This Leica DC Vario-Elmar lens offers the 35mm equivalent focal length of a 24-480mm lens with a maximum aperture of f/3.3 at the wide-angle end. This aperture is wide enough to capture low light action and the camera's Hybrid Optical Image Stabilization will compensate for camera shake to provide clear photos and videos when shooting at the telephoto lengths that this lens offers. If you need to reach a bit further, a 40x Intelligent Digital Zoom feature is also available. Aspherical and Extra-low Dispersion lens elements and Nano Surface Coating minimize aberrations and flaring for sharply rendered images. Full HD 1080p video recording with built-in stereo sound is supported by the ZS30 and a dedicated one-touch button will take you instantly from photo mode to video. You can also shoot still images while recording a video without cutting the video. Slow- and fast-motion video and multiple lower resolution recording is also possible and 5-Axis Correction minimizes blurring across the entire shooting range. A 3.0\" 920k-dot Touch-control LCD screen is provided for composition and playback. You can control autofocus, zoom, shutter and playback with simple gestures on the touch-screen. It also features an auto level gauge to keep your images straight. The DMC-ZS30 has built-in Wi-Fi and by downloading the Panasonic Image App to your iOS or Android smart phone or tablet, you can wirelessly send your shots to your device for instant sharing and storage. The App also allows you to use your device as a remote control for shooting and viewing photos and HD video. NFC (Near Field Communication) allows you to connect camera to phone with just a touch and sharing images with a friend's phone is just as easy. Direct upload to social networking sites, auto transfer and wireless TV playback are all possible with the Image App. The camera also has built-in GPS with geo-tagging, mapping and compass functions. The ZS30 offers full resolution burst shooting of 10 frames per second and its Intelligent Auto mode allows the camera to set the optimal adjustments while you compose and shoot. If you want your settings to be even more specific, 18 individual photo Scene Modes, such as Panorama, Sunset or Night Portrait, offer predefined settings that correspond to the scene you are shooting. High Dynamic Range is included to capture balanced shots of scenes that contain both dark shadows and bright areas. Four photo aspect ratios in multiple resolutions are available (4:3, 3:2, 16:9 and square-shaped 1:1) and manual exposure control is supported so you can adjust aperture and shutter speed to create images exactly the way you envision. For expressive imaging, Creative Control and Creative Retouch allow you to add 14 artistic effects before or after you shoot, for example Retro look, Toy Effect or One Point Color. Creative Panorama offers the same effects on panorama images and Creative Control is also supported in video mode. The DMC-ZS30 is conveniently powered by both a conventional AC adapter and via the USB input, so you can use your computer to charge your camera. PHOTOfunSTUDIO 9.0 image management software is included with your purchase.
