Autofocus is said to be greatly improved via High Speed AF, and the camera offers 6.4fps burst rate with no buffer delay. Zoom framing Assist tracks and captures moving subjects while using the longer telephoto lengths. The camera zooms out so you can find a moving subject, then zooms in quickly to capture it up close. If you've ever tried following a moving subject with a long focal length lens, you know this is a great feature. The Canon SX60 has built-in Wi-Fi for iOS and Android devices and NFC wireless connectivity for Android devices only.
