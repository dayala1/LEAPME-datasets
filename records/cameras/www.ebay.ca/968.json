Built to make advanced photography simple and fun, the new Rebel T4i delivers phenomenal image quality, high performance, and fast, intuitive operation. This EOS Rebel amps up the speed with the powerful DIGIC 5 Image Processor that helps make high-speed continuous shooting of up to 5.0 fps possible\u00e2\u0080\u0094great for capturing fast action. An 18.0 Megapixel CMOS sensor ensures that every image is shot in superb, high resolution; and an extended ISO range of 100-12800 gives photographers the opportunities to take the Rebel T4i into more shooting situations than ever before. A 9-point all cross-type AF system (including a high-precision dual cross f/2.8 center point) delivers improved autofocus performance, and a new Hybrid CMOS AF System increases autofocus speed when shooting photos and video in Live View. For users interested in creating impressive videos, the Rebel T4i is ready to help you create your next masterpiece. Movie Servo AF provides continuous focus of moving subjects, so you never miss a moment. A built-in stereo microphone and manual audio level adjustment helps ensure that your audio will match the stunning quality of your video. First ever for an EOS Rebel, the Rebel T4i features a Vari-angle Touch Screen 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor II, which allows fast and intuitive camera operation. Add compatibility with Canon's proven EF and EF-S lenses and a slew of EOS accessories, the Rebel T4i is an incredibly versatile tool for creating the images and videos you envision. 18.0 Megapixel CMOS (APS-C) sensor. The EOS Rebel T4i features Canon's amazing 18.0 Megapixel CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) sensor. Perfect for enlargements or for cropping detailed portions of the composition, the EOS Rebel T4i's sensor captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range. This first-class sensor features many of the same new technologies used by professional Canon cameras to maximize each pixel's light-gathering efficiency and has center pixels that aid in the EOS Rebel T4i's accurate AF performance. This APS-C size sensor creates an effective 1.6x field of view (compared to 35mm format). DIGIC 5 Image Processor The Rebel T4i is the first Rebel to feature Canon's DIGIC 5 Image Processor. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor works with the camera's CMOS sensor to deliver images with incredible detail in more situations, without the need for artificial light sources. With the power of the DIGIC 5 Image Processor the Rebel T4i can achieve higher ISO sensitivity, can shoot up to 5.0 fps continuously and can even perform advanced functions like HDR Backlight Control, art filters, lens correction and much more. The brilliant \"brain\" of the camera, this imaging engine supercharges every facet of still and moving image capture. Improved autofocus performance and new Hybrid CMOS AF. The EOS Rebel T4i is equipped with AF features that ensure speedy, accurate and continuous AF every time. When shooting through the viewfinder, the EOS Rebel T4i has improved autofocus with a new 9-point, all cross-type AF system (including high-precision dual-cross f/2.8 center point) for accurate focus whether the camera is oriented in portrait or landscape position. A new AI Servo AF system achieves and maintains consistent focus with an exceptional degree of reliability. Enhanced EOS Full HD Movie Mode with Movie Servo AF. The EOS Rebel T4i offers easy to use, professional video capture without compromise. Capable of shooting in a number of recording sizes and frame rates the Rebel T4i sets a whole new standard for performance, quality and simplicity. The Rebel T4i enables easy manual control of exposure, focus and Live View features, even in-camera editing! New Movie Servo AF allows continuous autofocus tracking of moving subjects while recording video. When shooting video with one of Canon's new STM lenses, Movie Servo AF takes advantage of the lens' stepping motor for smooth and quiet continuous AF. With an STM lens attached, the EOS Rebel T4i sets a new standard for SLR moviemaking performance! Video Snapshot. With the Video Snapshot feature, the EOS Rebel T4i DSLR can capture short video clips (of 2, 4 or 8 seconds) then combine them automatically into one video file as a snapshot or highlights \"album.\" With no editing needed after shooting, the compiled video is perfect for sharing online or displaying directly on an HDTV via the camera's HDMI port. Additionally, stills can be recorded during video shooting simply by pressing the camera's shutter button. During playback, video clips in an album can now be reordered or deleted. New Vari-angle Touch Screen 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor II with multi-touch operation and Touch AF. The EOS Rebel T4i comes with a newly engineered, Vari-angle Touch Screen 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor II. Using the same capacitive technology as today's popular mobile devices, this new screen is touch-sensitive and delivers intuitive touch panel operation. Two finger touch gestures (multi-touch) can be used for zooming or changing images, menu and quick control settings can be accessed, and focus point and shutter release can be activated with the touch of a fingertip. Displaying fine detail (at approximately 1.04 million dots), this screen is perfect for composing and reviewing images. Thanks to a new, solid construction between the monitor's resin-coated cover and the liquid crystal display, reflections are minimized, and the display can be viewed, without glare, from any number of angles. The LCD's surface is treated with a smudge-resistant coating to minimize fingerprints and maintain a bright, clear image display. HDR Backlight Control mode. The EOS Rebel T4i's HDR Backlight Control mode ensures that backlit subjects are not recorded too dark. By shooting three consecutive shots at different exposures (underexposed, correctly exposed and overexposed) and then combining the images, the final result maintains detail in both the shadow and highlight areas, ensuring the backlit subject is properly exposed. Multi Shot Noise Reduction. To enhance its already admirable high ISO shooting capabilities, the EOS Rebel T4i features an intelligent Multi Shot Noise Reduction tool that reduces noise even further than the camera's sensor and the DIGIC 5 Image Processor alone. With Multi Shot Noise Reduction activated, the camera takes four consecutive shots, merges and aligns them. This eliminates more noise than the Rebel's traditional Noise Reduction filter, with little or no apparent resolution loss. Moving subjects are even optimized to minimize subject blur! Thanks to this clever new feature, high ISO shooting has never looked better. Flexible and Reliable Recording.. Compatibility with SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards, including new Ultra High Speed cards : The EOS Rebel T4i uses popular SD, SDHC, SDXC and is even compatible with the newest Ultra High Speed (UHS-I) memory cards. Compact and available in large capacities, SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards are a perfect complement to the EOS Rebel T4i's compact design. Additionally, the EOS Rebel T4i is compatible with Eye-Fi\u00e2\u0088\u0097 SD cards, which are outfitted with a Wi-Fi\u00c2\u00ae transmitter (IEEE 802.11b/g) and an internal antenna for wireless, high-speed transfer of images. With an Eye-Fi card installed, the EOS Rebel T4i can display the Eye-Fi's connection status and error notes with ease, for fully functional wireless uploading of images directly from the camera. Shooting Made Easy. EF & EF-S Lenses The EOS Rebel T4i is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF lineup, including compact and lightweight EF-S lenses, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses and including the new STM series optimized for video shooting. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver outstanding performance and deliver beautiful results. Special technologies like Canon's Image Stabilizer technology help to minimize the effect of camera shake, effectively adding up to four stops of light; STM lenses even feature a stepping motor for smooth and quiet continuous autofocus while capturing video. With an array of lenses perfect for travel, sports, still life and everything in between, photographers can truly maximize the quality and performance of their EOS Rebel T4i.

Built to make advanced photography simple and fun, the new Rebel T4i delivers phenomenal image quality, high performance, and fast, intuitive operation. This EOS Rebel amps up the speed with the powerful DIGIC 5 Image Processor that helps make high-speed continuous shooting of up to 5.0 fps possible\u00e2\u0080\u0094great for capturing fast action. An 18.0 Megapixel CMOS sensor ensures that every image is shot in superb, high resolution; and an extended ISO range of 100-12800 gives photographers the opportunities to take the Rebel T4i into more shooting situations than ever before. A 9-point all cross-type AF system (including a high-precision dual cross f/2.8 center point) delivers improved autofocus performance, and a new Hybrid CMOS AF System increases autofocus speed when shooting photos and video in Live View. For users interested in creating impressive videos, the Rebel T4i is ready to help you create your next masterpiece. Movie Servo AF provides continuous focus of moving subjects, so you never miss a moment. A built-in stereo microphone and manual audio level adjustment helps ensure that your audio will match the stunning quality of your video. First ever for an EOS Rebel, the Rebel T4i features a Vari-angle Touch Screen 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor II, which allows fast and intuitive camera operation. Add compatibility with Canon's proven EF and EF-S lenses and a slew of EOS accessories, the Rebel T4i is an incredibly versatile tool for creating the images and videos you envision. 18.0 Megapixel CMOS (APS-C) sensor. The EOS Rebel T4i features Canon's amazing 18.0 Megapixel CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) sensor. Perfect for enlargements or for cropping detailed portions of the composition, the EOS Rebel T4i's sensor captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range. This first-class sensor features many of the same new technologies used by professional Canon cameras to maximize each pixel's light-gathering efficiency and has center pixels that aid in the EOS Rebel T4i's accurate AF performance. This APS-C size sensor creates an effective 1.6x field of view (compared to 35mm format). DIGIC 5 Image Processor The Rebel T4i is the first Rebel to feature Canon's DIGIC 5 Image Processor. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor works with the camera's CMOS sensor to deliver images with incredible detail in more situations, without the need for artificial light sources. With the power of the DIGIC 5 Image Processor the Rebel T4i can achieve higher ISO sensitivity, can shoot up to 5.0 fps continuously and can even perform advanced functions like HDR Backlight Control, art filters, lens correction and much more. The brilliant \"brain\" of the camera, this imaging engine supercharges every facet of still and moving image capture. Improved autofocus performance and new Hybrid CMOS AF. The EOS Rebel T4i is equipped with AF features that ensure speedy, accurate and continuous AF every time. When shooting through the viewfinder, the EOS Rebel T4i has improved autofocus with a new 9-point, all cross-type AF system (including high-precision dual-cross f/2.8 center point) for accurate focus whether the camera is oriented in portrait or landscape position. A new AI Servo AF system achieves and maintains consistent focus with an exceptional degree of reliability. Enhanced EOS Full HD Movie Mode with Movie Servo AF. The EOS Rebel T4i offers easy to use, professional video capture without compromise. Capable of shooting in a number of recording sizes and frame rates the Rebel T4i sets a whole new standard for performance, quality and simplicity. The Rebel T4i enables easy manual control of exposure, focus and Live View features, even in-camera editing! New Movie Servo AF allows continuous autofocus tracking of moving subjects while recording video. When shooting video with one of Canon's new STM lenses, Movie Servo AF takes advantage of the lens' stepping motor for smooth and quiet continuous AF. With an STM lens attached, the EOS Rebel T4i sets a new standard for SLR moviemaking performance! Video Snapshot. With the Video Snapshot feature, the EOS Rebel T4i DSLR can capture short video clips (of 2, 4 or 8 seconds) then combine them automatically into one video file as a snapshot or highlights \"album.\" With no editing needed after shooting, the compiled video is perfect for sharing online or displaying directly on an HDTV via the camera's HDMI port. Additionally, stills can be recorded during video shooting simply by pressing the camera's shutter button. During playback, video clips in an album can now be reordered or deleted. New Vari-angle Touch Screen 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor II with multi-touch operation and Touch AF. The EOS Rebel T4i comes with a newly engineered, Vari-angle Touch Screen 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor II. Using the same capacitive technology as today's popular mobile devices, this new screen is touch-sensitive and delivers intuitive touch panel operation. Two finger touch gestures (multi-touch) can be used for zooming or changing images, menu and quick control settings can be accessed, and focus point and shutter release can be activated with the touch of a fingertip. Displaying fine detail (at approximately 1.04 million dots), this screen is perfect for composing and reviewing images. Thanks to a new, solid construction between the monitor's resin-coated cover and the liquid crystal display, reflections are minimized, and the display can be viewed, without glare, from any number of angles. The LCD's surface is treated with a smudge-resistant coating to minimize fingerprints and maintain a bright, clear image display. HDR Backlight Control mode. The EOS Rebel T4i's HDR Backlight Control mode ensures that backlit subjects are not recorded too dark. By shooting three consecutive shots at different exposures (underexposed, correctly exposed and overexposed) and then combining the images, the final result maintains detail in both the shadow and highlight areas, ensuring the backlit subject is properly exposed. Multi Shot Noise Reduction. To enhance its already admirable high ISO shooting capabilities, the EOS Rebel T4i features an intelligent Multi Shot Noise Reduction tool that reduces noise even further than the camera's sensor and the DIGIC 5 Image Processor alone. With Multi Shot Noise Reduction activated, the camera takes four consecutive shots, merges and aligns them. This eliminates more noise than the Rebel's traditional Noise Reduction filter, with little or no apparent resolution loss. Moving subjects are even optimized to minimize subject blur! Thanks to this clever new feature, high ISO shooting has never looked better. Flexible and Reliable Recording.. Compatibility with SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards, including new Ultra High Speed cards : The EOS Rebel T4i uses popular SD, SDHC, SDXC and is even compatible with the newest Ultra High Speed (UHS-I) memory cards. Compact and available in large capacities, SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards are a perfect complement to the EOS Rebel T4i's compact design. Additionally, the EOS Rebel T4i is compatible with Eye-Fi\u00e2\u0088\u0097 SD cards, which are outfitted with a Wi-Fi\u00c2\u00ae transmitter (IEEE 802.11b/g) and an internal antenna for wireless, high-speed transfer of images. With an Eye-Fi card installed, the EOS Rebel T4i can display the Eye-Fi's connection status and error notes with ease, for fully functional wireless uploading of images directly from the camera. Shooting Made Easy. EF & EF-S Lenses The EOS Rebel T4i is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF lineup, including compact and lightweight EF-S lenses, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses and including the new STM series optimized for video shooting. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver outstanding performance and deliver beautiful results. Special technologies like Canon's Image Stabilizer technology help to minimize the effect of camera shake, effectively adding up to four stops of light; STM lenses even feature a stepping motor for smooth and quiet continuous autofocus while capturing video. With an array of lenses perfect for travel, sports, still life and everything in between, photographers can truly maximize the quality and performance of their EOS Rebel T4i.
