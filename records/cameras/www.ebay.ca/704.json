Part: DMCFZ1000K Item Includes Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ1000 Digital Camera - Battery Pack - Battery Charger - USB Cable - Lens Hood - Lens Cap - Hot Shoe Cover - Software DVD (PHOTOfunSTUDIO 9.5E, SILKYPIX Developer Studio, LoiLoScope Trial Version, Adobe Reader) - 1 Year Warranty Description The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ1000 Digital Camera offers a true Hybrid Photography experience for everyone. It combines 4K video recording capability (QFHD 4K - 3840 x 2160, 30 fps in MP4) with the ability to switch easily between video and still capture for the ultimate in image creativity. The FZ1000 also enables in-camera playback screen grabs of (3840 x 2160) 8-megapixel equivalent hybrid photography photos from 4K video footage to capture the spur-of-the-moment shots often missed with ordinary still photos. 4K QFHD Video - Vibrant, Realistic Motion Experience the world of 4K video capture. Enjoy true-to-life, ultra high-resolution images in smooth motion. Plus, the realistic ambience of audio recording with the optional Stereo / Shotgun Microphone (DMW-MS2) with the ability to adjust sound gathering characteristics to match any shooting situation. For even greater versatility, switch to manual operation in Creative Video mode and dramatic slow motion in full-HD 120 fps video. Express Yourself - Anywhere You Go The FZ1000 is the Panasonic LUMIX flagship bridge camera with ultimate image quality. The superb images produced with a large 1-inch sensor and all-new lens fully express the limitless depth and sunlit warmth of nature. Its 16x optical zoom brings everything up close, from tiny birds on tree branches to animals crossing the distant horizon. Choose photos or videos in crisp 4K resolution. The DMC-FZ1000 is all you need to capture the world around you, in all its natural beauty. Large 1-inch 20 megapixel MOS Sensor The newly incorporated 1-inch 20.1-megapixel High Sensitivity MOS Sensor improves the S/N ratio, making it possible to capture clear images with minimum noise even when shot at ISO12800 / Extended ISO25600. Rich amounts of light help produce impressive defocus with shallow depth of field. The result is truly stunning images in a wide variety of shooting conditions. Bright LEICA DC Lens - F2.8-4.0 25-400mm The new LEICA DC VARIO-ELMARIT lens is created especially for the DMC-FZ1000. It has an F2.8-4.0 brightness that resists blurring even with telephoto shots and an angle of view that extends from 25mm wide-angle to 16x optical zoom. Comprising 15 elements in 11 groups, including 4 ED lenses and 5 aspherical lenses with 8 aspherical surfaces, this advanced lens unit achieves high MTF value. Adoption of 5 aspherical glass lenses achieves beautiful, evenly smooth defocus with invisible edge line, which is made possible by Panasonic's unique aspherical lens mold technology. Light Speed AF with LUMIX DFD Focus Technology A new linear motor integrated into the focus system achieves approx. 275% faster focusing, compared to the conventional DMC-FZ200. In addition new DFD (Depth From Defocus) technology shortens the time to set the focus. It instantaneously calculates the distance to the subject by evaluating 2 images with different sharp ness levels. As a result, ultra high-speed AF of approx. 0.09 sec (wide-end) / approx. 0.17 sec (tele-end) is achieved. 5-Axis Correction / Tilt Correction The HYBRID O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) + with 5-axis correction gives you blur-less, one-handed video shooting ability. It detects and compensates for the camera's 5 types of movement - horizontal, vertical, axis of rotation, vertical rotation and horizontal rotation. The Level Shot Function detects the image's horizontal line and maintains it even if the camera is tilted. It takes stable video even in high-angle, blind recording. Smartphone Enabled Remote Shooting / Remote View With the Panasonic Image App, you can utilize a smartphone or tablet as a remote controller to zoom, set the focus and shoot from a distance. Easy Share Instantly upload and share images on social media using the Panasonic Image App on a smartphone or tablet. Easy Connection Simply touching an NFC-compatible smartphone / tablet to the camera, or scanning the QR code connects to Wi-Fi. Geotagging Tag location information to the image by utilizing the GPS log of a smartphone / tablet and share it to the preferred social media. Macro Photography to 3cm Stunning macro shots can be shot with minimum focusing distance of 3cm. You can enjoy shooting close-up shots with the DMC-FZ1000 only to express spectacular details of flowers, insects and so on. In-camera Creative Control / Creative Panorama In-camera Creative Control adds artistic and original expression to your photos and videos. Plus, create vertical / horizontal panoramic photos with a unique touch just by swiveling the camera. Multiple Accessory Options to Choose From For a more rewarding Hybrid Photography experience, add an optional External Flash (DMW-FL580L) with built-in LCD video light. The FZ1000 videos offer high-quality, highly realistic Dolby Digital stereo sound from a built-in microphone. A stereo zoom microphone features a zoom noise reduction system and a Auto Wind Cut function blocks out most of the noise from background wind. With the optional DMW-MS2 Stereo/Shotgun Microphone, you can adjust the sound gathering characteristics to match the shooting situation. The impressive flexibility of DMC-FZ1000 goes far beyond the limit of conventional bridge camera.
