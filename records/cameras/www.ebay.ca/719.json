Part: V104140BU000 Item Includes Olympus Tough TG-3 Digital Camera - Waterproof Instructions - Wrist Strap - LI-92B Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery - USB Cable (CB-USB8) - AC Adapter (F-2AC) - Quick Start Guide - CD-ROM with Instruction Manual and Olympus Viewer 3 Software - Olympus 1 Year Limited Warranty Description Strength and sophistication - two words that define the Olympus Tough TG-3 Digital Camera. This ultra-rugged camera's super-bright f2.0 lens delivers superb image quality in the harshest conditions. Features like Wi-Fi (remote camera operation, easy file sharing), time-interval shooting (similar to popular action cams), time-lapse movie (sunsets! starscapes!) and advanced GPS make the TG-3 Olympus's most versatile outdoor camera ever. The TG-3 is unique among outdoor cameras for its many accessories. Waterproof lens options include a fisheye converter that captures gorgeous wide-angle shots - even underwater - and a tele converter that increases zoom capability from 4x to nearly 7x. Also available are a new LED ring light for macro photography and colorful float straps, an underwater housing and sturdy cases. The Best & The Curious Quick start-up and fast autofocus - courtesy of Olympus iHS and FAST AF technology - ensure you're always ready to shoot. The TG-3 dials up the shutter speed for blur-free action images, thanks to its ultra-bright high-speed f2.0 lens. You can also reduce the ISO to shoot crisp, detailed images with minimal noise in low light, or use the Aperture priority mode to expand the focus range of the background. Connect with your smart devices The TG-3's built-in Wi-Fi and the free Olympus Image Share app turn your smart device into a remote extension of your camera. You can operate the zoom, adjust settings and AF points and trip the shutter. You can geotag photos and share files with the world. And you can apply custom signatures and stamps to your work. More ways to capture the action Mount the TG-3 on your bike, kayak or surfboard. Set up Interval Shooting - camera start-up time and intervals between shots (both from 1 second to 24 hours). Snap up to 99 frames. Compile the images automatically into a time-lapse movie lasting up to 10 seconds (720p at 10 fps). Enjoy the oohs and aahs of your friends. Get back on the beaten path If you venture a little too far off the beaten path, your TG-3 can help. Its next-generation GPS accurately locates your position within 10 seconds. Landmark information can be displayed and recorded with every shot. The built-in e.Compass offers information on direction, latitude and longitude as well as elevation and water depth...in case you push the limits to the extreme. Journey to worlds within The TG-3 offers four macro modes: Microscope, Microscope Control (maximum 44.5x magnification from 1cm), Focus Bracketing and Focus Stacking (multiple images are taken from foreground to background and the areas in focus are automatically merged into one perfect shot). Add the new LED ring light and you've got a complete portable macro set-up. Features 16MP BSI CMOS Sensor (1/2.3\") High-Speed, Ultra-Bright f2.0 Lens 4x Wide Zoom Lens (25mm) Shockproof to 7ft.
