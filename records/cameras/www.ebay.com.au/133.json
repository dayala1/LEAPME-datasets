This Chinese company has already been prooven to produce \u00a0good  quality with a reasonable price marked with the extremely successful  YN-460, YN-560 and their TTL flashes. Features Highlights Wireless TTL Slave: Use  the comfort of TTL wirelessly with Canon eTTL and Nikon i-TTL! The  YN-565EX serves as a wireless TTL slave which is triggered by a  compatible master flash like the Canon 580 EX II or Nikon SB-900, a  camera with commander function like Canon 60D or wireless commander like  ST-E2. If there is no commander function or master flash it still can  be used with TTL on top of a compatible camera. In TTL slave mode 3  groups A, B, C and 4 channels are supported. Please note that the  YN-565EX cannot serve as a wireless TTL master and does not support  HSS. Flash Mode Manual, S1, S2: Many  photographers like the manual mode in strobist photography, because it  gives them most freedom in composing their pictures. You can adjust the  power level from 1/128 to 1/1 in 1/3EV steps. Also you can use the  optical slave modes S1 and S2. Which allow optical triggering by other  flashes without need of an additional trigger. The S2 mode supresses the  TTL metering flash. Multi Mode: In  this mode a sequence of rapid flashes is fired and give interesting  effects. You can adjust the number and frequency of flashes. Big LCD with advanced settings: The  big back-lit LCD is quite comfortable and for newer Canon cameras all  information is also available in the camera menu and can be set there as  well. Settings can be saved to a hot key which makes it \u00a0fast  accessible right if you need it. The last settings are automatically  saved. Auto Zoom Head, Wide Angle Diffuser and Bounce Card: The  flash head zooms automatically or manually to the focal length  transmitted by the camera in steps of\u00a024, 28, 35, 50, 70, 80, 105mm. The  zoom range can be extended to 18mm by the diffuser. Also the head can  be rotated horizontally and vertically in wide angles. High Output Power of GN58: The high output power of GN58 at ISO 100 and 35mm is suitable for most shooting situations. Modeling Light and Test Flash: The  YN-565EX fires for 1 second if the depth of field button of the camera  is pressed. Also a test flash is fired if the pilot button is pressed. The Read Beep informs if the flash is ready to fire after charging. An Overheat Protection pauses the flash for 30 seconds in case of overheating to prevent damaging. A quite handy feature is the Configurable Power Saving Mode . For longer strobist sessions the Socket for an External Battery Pack can be useful to extend the time of shooting. Also a PC Sync Socked is build-in for the use with flash triggers or PC sync cables. Further features are Flash Exposure Compensation (FEC) of -5EV in 1/3EV steps. Flash Exposure Bracketing (FEB) for 3 pictures in a row\u00a0and Rear-Curtain Sync .
