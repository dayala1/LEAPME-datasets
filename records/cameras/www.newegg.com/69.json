    "feature": "Quick start-up and fast autofocus -courtesy of Olympus iHS and FAST AF technology -ensure you're always ready to shoot. The TG-3 dials up the shutter speed for blur-free action images, thanks to its ultra-bright high-speed f2.0 lens. You can also reduce the ISO to shoot crisp, detailed images with minimal noise in low light, or use the Aperture priority mode to expand the focus range of the background. The TG-3's built-in WiFi and the free Olympus Image Share app turn your smart device into a remote extension of your camera. You can operate the zoom, adjust settings and AF points, and trip the shutter. You can geotag photos and share files with the world. And you can apply custom signatures and stamps to your work. Mount the TG-3 on your bike, kayak or surfboard. Set up Interval Shooting -camera start-up time and intervals between shots (both from 1 second to 24 hours). Snap up to 99 frames. Compile the images automatically into a time-lapse movie lasting up to 10 seconds (720p at 10 fps). Enjoy the oohs and aahs of your friends. If you venture a little too far off the beaten path, your TG-3 can help. Its next-generation GPS accurately locates your position within 10 seconds. Landmark information can be displayed and recorded with every shot. The built-in e.Compass offers information on direction, latitude and longitude as well as elevation and water depth...in case you push the limits to the extreme. Pair the TG-3 with the OLYMPUS Image Track (OI.Track) smartphone app so you can transfer GPS logs and pictures from your camera to your smartphone. The TG-3 offers four macro modes: Microscope, Microscope Control (maximum 44.5x magnification from 1cm), Focus Bracketing and Focus Stacking (multiple images are taken from foreground to background, and the areas in focus are automatically merged into one perfect shot). Add the new LED light guide and you\u2019ve got a complete portable macro set-up.",
