Both the sensor and processor work together to produce well-detailed, clear imagery that exhibits natural tonality and color gradations with minimal noise when working in difficult lighting conditions. The processor also provides notable speed throughout the camera system, including the ability to record up to 7 fps in full-resolution, quickened AF speeds, and full HD 1080p video recording in multiple frame rates with manual exposure and audio level control. Serving live view in both still and movie shooting modes, Dual Pixel CMOS AF is a powerful technology that revolves around the incorporation of two photodiodes within each pixel to provide an expansive phase-detection focusing system. This system affords focusing benefits that are similar to how a camcorder works and as such can focus on subjects in an incredibly fast and precise manner. The benefits of this system are three-fold: the ability to focus quickly and smoothly; the ability to truly utilize the vari-angle touchscreen LCD monitor to its full potential; and the ability to utilize a wide range of over 100 EF and EF-S lenses. Also benefiting from Dual Pixel CMOS AF is the Movie Servo AF mode, which enables continuous auto focusing when recording movies. This focusing mode is especially useful for maintaining critical focus on moving subjects and for realizing the near-silent performance of compatible STM lenses. The 3.0\" 1,040k-dot vari-angle Clear View II touchscreen LCD monitor profits greatly from the advent of the Dual Pixel CMOS AF system and its ability to utilize Touch AF focusing for finely controlled selection of the point of focus. The monitor's vari-angle design also enables more efficient shooting and viewing from both high and low angles and an anti-reflective, smudge-resistant coating allows for clear viewing in any lighting condition. In addition to the LCD monitor, the 70D also features an optical pentaprism finder that can be used for eye-level shooting of still images. This Intelligent Viewfinder incorporates a superimposed LCD to provide an intuitive means for monitoring exposure and camera settings during shooting. While working with the viewfinder, an expansive 19-point all cross-type AF system is visualized for acquiring focus; integral to this array is a high-precision dual-cross center AF point that is compatible with f/2.8 and faster lenses. Providing a wealth of additional functionality to the camera is integrated Wi-Fi connectivity, which allows for the instant and direct sharing of image files to an iOS or Android mobile device for sharing online. This functionality also allows for wireless remote control over camera settings, including exposure controls, focusing, and shutter release, from a mobile device when using the Canon EOS Remote app. The EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM lens is included along with the camera body to serve as a versatile everyday lens that encompasses a 35mm-equivalent focal length range of 28.8-88mm. The STM stepping motor helps to achieve near-silent focusing when used in conjunction with the Movie Servo AF mode and the optical image stabilization system helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake. Dual Pixel CMOS AF Dual Pixel CMOS AF is a refined live view focusing technology     that works to provide incredibly quick and precise auto focusing     abilities that function in a similar manner to how a camcorder acquires     focus. This system integrates two separate photodiodes within each pixel     to provide a broad and dense network of phase-detection gathering     elements to help reduce focus hunting for faster, more direct control of     focus placement. Dual Pixel CMOS AF is utilized during live view     applications, for either still or video shooting, and enables an     enhanced method of working with the vari-angle touchscreen LCD monitor. When working with still imagery, this focusing system works to acquire     focus quickly and accurately, making it ideally suited to shooting and     tracking moving subjects and ensuring critical focus is attained with     each shot. When shooting video, focusing is smooth and natural when     changing from different subjects or different distances within the     scene. Benefited by the Touch AF system, rack focus is possible simply     by touching elements within the scene on the touchscreen in order to     change focus in an intuitive manner. Subject tracking in movies is also     heightened due to the Dual Pixel CMOS AF system's ability to recognize     subjects and maintain focus when working within changing or cluttered     scenery. This focusing system provides full and intuitive use of the vari-angle     touchscreen monitor through its keen integration of touch controls for     focusing and articulating design of the screen for viewing from any     shooting angle. Additionally, Dual Pixel CMOS AF is fully supported by     over 100 current and former EF and EF-S lenses to offer a wide spectrum     of compatibility for both still and video applications. 20.2MP CMOS Sensor and DIGIC 5+ Image Processor In regard to imaging capabilities, the EOS 70D features a 20.2     megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5+ image processor to produce     high-resolution, well-detailed still imagery and full HD 1080p video     with notable low-light sensitivity. These two technologies work together     to enable 14-bit A/D conversion, which helps to improve the quality and     gradation of imagery by producing smoother, more natural-looking     results with minimal image noise. A native ISO sensitivity of 100-12800     is well-suited to working in difficult lighting conditions and the     processing power of the DIGIC 5+ processor also affords a wealth of     speed to all aspects of the camera, including a full-resolution     continuous shooting rate of 7 fps. Built-In Wireless Connectivity Integrated Wi-Fi enables remote control over the camera's     exposure settings (aperture, shutter speed, and ISO) as well as focus     and the shutter release from an iOS or Android mobile device when using     the Canon EOS Remote app. With this app, you can wireless control the     70D from a distance and utilize live view monitoring from your mobile     device for easier shooting from difficult angles and locations. Images     from the 70D can be backed-up to other wireless-enabled Canon cameras as     well as networked PCs and mobile devices for instant sharing via email     or to social networking and image hosting sites. Full DNLA (Digital     Living Network Alliance) compatibility also enables transferring of     files to other DNLA-compatible products like HDTVs and other wireless     devices for remote viewing and playback. When working from the camera     alone, files can also be transferred directly to the CANON iMAGE GATEWAY     for expedited sharing to social networking sites without the need of a     PC. PictBridge compatibility is also available and offers support for     wirelessly printing photos from the camera on a PictBridge-compatible     printer. When used in combination with the optional GP-E2 GPS Receiver,     geotagging and embedding of locational data into images' metadata is     possible for plotting imagery to maps and for recording the elevation,     direction, and Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) of each photograph. Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM Lens Included with the 70D is the EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM lens,     which provides a 35mm-equivalent focal length of 28.8-88mm. Covering a     range of perspectives from wide-angle to portrait-length, this lens is a     highly versatile tool for use in everyday situations for both still     image and movie recording. Its design integrates an STM stepping motor     that provides near-silent focusing abilities with smooth and precise     control. Additionally, the optical image stabilization system helps to     minimize the appearance of camera shake by up to four shutter speed     steps in order to benefit working in low-light conditions and with     greater zoom magnifications. One aspherical lens element is also     incorporated into the lens construction to help reduce chromatic     aberrations throughout the zoom range and an optimized lens coating has     been applied, too, in order to lessen lens flare and ghosting for higher     contrast, clearer imagery. EOS HD Video Full HD 1080p video recording is supported at 30, 24, and 25 fps     as well as HD and SD video recording in multiple frame rates. Video is     recorded using the high quality H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec and manual     exposure control is supported for greater refinement over the look and     feel of recordings. Video clips are automatically partitioned after the     file size has reached 4GB and both IPB and All i-frame compressions are     available for use depending on editing and output preferences. Sound can     be recorded using the built-in stereo microphone, or with an optional     external microphone using the 3.5mm microphone terminal, and controlled     manually across 64 levels. An attenuator function is also employed to     prevent audio clipping for cleaner overall sound. Movie Servo AF mode is available to provide continuous auto focusing     when recording video and pairs especially well when using an STM lens to     realize near-silent focusing during filming. Focusing is also heavily     benefited by the incorporation of the Dual Pixel CMOS AF system to     provide smooth, controllable focusing in live view with the added     benefit of the Touch AF function. The Video Snapshot mode can also be used to record short video clips, in     2, 4, or 8-second segments, and in-camera editing and music can be     applied to these files for finalized results straight from the camera. 3.0\" Clear View II LCD Monitor and Intelligent Viewfinder A large, bright 3.0\" 1,040k-dot vari-angle Clear View II     touchscreen LCD monitor is integrated into the 70D to enable clear live     view monitoring, image playback, and intuitive menu navigation. It's     vari-angle design aids in viewing from high and low angles and the     touchscreen control gives way to efficient navigation of menus and     shooting controls, as well as precise control over focus points. The     screen's construction incorporates an anti-reflective, smudge-resistant     coating to provide clearer viewing, even in bright, sunlit conditions. When working with still imagery and shooting at eye-level, an optical     pentaprism Intelligent Viewfinder is available and provides 98% frame     coverage. A superimposed LCD screen within the viewfinder provides     pertinent exposure and camera information for more efficient eye-level     shooting and also has the ability to outline AF points, grid lines, and     an electronic level to aid in composition. 19-Point All Cross-Type AF System When shooting with the optical viewfinder, a 19-point all     cross-type autofocus system is used to provide a wide range of focusing     coverage for acquiring focus accurately and quickly. The center point of     this cluster is a high-precision dual cross-type sensor that supports     focusing with f/2.8 and faster lenses in order to benefit focusing in     low-light conditions. These focus points are configurable and allow     homing in on specific elements within the frame to focus on, or,     alternatively, all can be used to provide coverage across the frame. iFCL 63-Zone Dual Layer Metering Sensor An intelligent metering system works in conjunction with the     autofocus system and independently analyzes focus, color, and luminance     within the scene for the most precise exposure settings possible. The 63     zones cover the entire image area with great detail and the dual-layer     design permits a wider sensitivity to different wavelengths of light.     The dual layers are split into a red/green channel and a blue/green     channel; which counters the red light sensitivity bias electronic     sensors inherently have. A series of algorithms are employed to combine     data received from both layers, with the resulting exposure reading     being extremely accurate regardless of the shooting conditions. This metering system employs evaluative, center-weighted, and spot     metering methods to determine exposure, as well as allowing for a +/- 5     EV exposure compensation for greater manipulation of the determined     exposure setting. Built-In HDR and Multiple Exposure Modes A High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode is available and allows for the     creation of HDR images in-camera, reducing the time needed to manually     overlay images in post-production. When using this mode, a series of     bracketed exposures are made of the same image, then automatically     composited, resulting in a photograph with controlled highlights,     detailed shadows, and a long middle range of tones. This mode is     especially useful when photographing scenes with a great deal of     contrast. Multiple exposures are also possible in-camera and up to 9 exposures can     be recorded onto a single file using two distinct settings for control.     When in Additive mode, this closely resembles making multiple exposures     on film and layers each exposure; manual exposure compensation is     required. Average mode layers the images and automatically compensates     for the final exposure, eliminating the unintended possibility of gross     under or overexposure. Multiple exposures can be recorded in either JPEG     or RAW formats, and furthermore you can utilize an existing RAW image     as a starting point from which to layer subsequent images, which can     then be manipulated in real time on the LCD. Scene Intelligent Auto and Special Scene Modes Scene Intelligent Auto mode incorporates a number of Canon's     automatic exposure technology together in order to output a well-refined     exposure. Picture Style Auto, Automatic Lighting Optimizer, Automatic     White Balance, Autofocus, and Automatic Exposure are all employed to     intelligently analyze the scene at hand and produce the most effective     exposure settings to clearly render your subject matter. Special Scene modes also help to enhance your imagery by applying a     system of corrections for use in more difficult lighting situations.     Handheld Night Scene automatically captures four consecutive exposures,     at shutter speeds fast enough to handhold, and layers them into a single     frame. This allows you to effectively record images in darker     situations without the need of a tripod or stabilization device. HDR     Backlight Control works in the same manner and records a series of     exposures at different values to ensure highlight and shadow values are     not lost. These under and over-exposed images are blended to create a     final image with a wider dynamic range. Other Camera Features Multi Shot Noise Reduction automatically composites four     sequential exposures together in order to gain one exposure that     exhibits minimal apparent noise. Peripheral illumination, chromatic aberration, and distortion     corrections are available and programmable through a menu of different     available EF lenses. This lens data is used to automatically correct for     each individual lens' traits to produce the cleanest image possible. Seven Creative Filters are available to aesthetically modify the     appearance of imagery in-camera, with the results visible in real time     when working in live view. These filters include Grainy Black and White,     Soft Focus, Fisheye Effect, Toy Camera Effect, Miniature Effect, Art     Bold Effect, and Water Painting Effect. Compatible with SD, SDHC, and SDXC, including Ultra High Speed (UHS-I), memory cards. Compatible with eTTL II flash metering for use with compatible external flash units. A built-in pop-up flash is available to provide additional illumination to scenes. Silent shooting is a low-vibration shooting mode that slows and     mutes the shutter and mirror reflex, enabling a more discrete method of     capturing imagery. In-camera RAW processing allows for the converting of RAW image     files to JPEGs without the need for a computer. When using this     function, 10 process variables-brightness adjustment, white balance,     Picture Style, Auto Lighting Optimizer, noise reduction, JPEG     image-recording quality, color space, lens peripheral illumination     correction, distortion correction, and chromatic aberration     correction-are available for fine-tuning the appearance of photos. A Feature Guide can be employed to help explain and the specific     functions of each dedicated camera control to help for properly applying     a variety of settings while shooting.

Both the sensor and processor work together to produce well-detailed, clear imagery that exhibits natural tonality and color gradations with minimal noise when working in difficult lighting conditions. The processor also provides notable speed throughout the camera system, including the ability to record up to 7 fps in full-resolution, quickened AF speeds, and full HD 1080p video recording in multiple frame rates with manual exposure and audio level control. Serving live view in both still and movie shooting modes, Dual Pixel CMOS AF is a powerful technology that revolves around the incorporation of two photodiodes within each pixel to provide an expansive phase-detection focusing system. This system affords focusing benefits that are similar to how a camcorder works and as such can focus on subjects in an incredibly fast and precise manner. The benefits of this system are three-fold: the ability to focus quickly and smoothly; the ability to truly utilize the vari-angle touchscreen LCD monitor to its full potential; and the ability to utilize a wide range of over 100 EF and EF-S lenses. Also benefiting from Dual Pixel CMOS AF is the Movie Servo AF mode, which enables continuous auto focusing when recording movies. This focusing mode is especially useful for maintaining critical focus on moving subjects and for realizing the near-silent performance of compatible STM lenses. The 3.0\" 1,040k-dot vari-angle Clear View II touchscreen LCD monitor profits greatly from the advent of the Dual Pixel CMOS AF system and its ability to utilize Touch AF focusing for finely controlled selection of the point of focus. The monitor's vari-angle design also enables more efficient shooting and viewing from both high and low angles and an anti-reflective, smudge-resistant coating allows for clear viewing in any lighting condition. In addition to the LCD monitor, the 70D also features an optical pentaprism finder that can be used for eye-level shooting of still images. This Intelligent Viewfinder incorporates a superimposed LCD to provide an intuitive means for monitoring exposure and camera settings during shooting. While working with the viewfinder, an expansive 19-point all cross-type AF system is visualized for acquiring focus; integral to this array is a high-precision dual-cross center AF point that is compatible with f/2.8 and faster lenses. Providing a wealth of additional functionality to the camera is integrated Wi-Fi connectivity, which allows for the instant and direct sharing of image files to an iOS or Android mobile device for sharing online. This functionality also allows for wireless remote control over camera settings, including exposure controls, focusing, and shutter release, from a mobile device when using the Canon EOS Remote app. The EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM lens is included along with the camera body to serve as a versatile everyday lens that encompasses a 35mm-equivalent focal length range of 28.8-88mm. The STM stepping motor helps to achieve near-silent focusing when used in conjunction with the Movie Servo AF mode and the optical image stabilization system helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake. Dual Pixel CMOS AF Dual Pixel CMOS AF is a refined live view focusing technology     that works to provide incredibly quick and precise auto focusing     abilities that function in a similar manner to how a camcorder acquires     focus. This system integrates two separate photodiodes within each pixel     to provide a broad and dense network of phase-detection gathering     elements to help reduce focus hunting for faster, more direct control of     focus placement. Dual Pixel CMOS AF is utilized during live view     applications, for either still or video shooting, and enables an     enhanced method of working with the vari-angle touchscreen LCD monitor. When working with still imagery, this focusing system works to acquire     focus quickly and accurately, making it ideally suited to shooting and     tracking moving subjects and ensuring critical focus is attained with     each shot. When shooting video, focusing is smooth and natural when     changing from different subjects or different distances within the     scene. Benefited by the Touch AF system, rack focus is possible simply     by touching elements within the scene on the touchscreen in order to     change focus in an intuitive manner. Subject tracking in movies is also     heightened due to the Dual Pixel CMOS AF system's ability to recognize     subjects and maintain focus when working within changing or cluttered     scenery. This focusing system provides full and intuitive use of the vari-angle     touchscreen monitor through its keen integration of touch controls for     focusing and articulating design of the screen for viewing from any     shooting angle. Additionally, Dual Pixel CMOS AF is fully supported by     over 100 current and former EF and EF-S lenses to offer a wide spectrum     of compatibility for both still and video applications. 20.2MP CMOS Sensor and DIGIC 5+ Image Processor In regard to imaging capabilities, the EOS 70D features a 20.2     megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5+ image processor to produce     high-resolution, well-detailed still imagery and full HD 1080p video     with notable low-light sensitivity. These two technologies work together     to enable 14-bit A/D conversion, which helps to improve the quality and     gradation of imagery by producing smoother, more natural-looking     results with minimal image noise. A native ISO sensitivity of 100-12800     is well-suited to working in difficult lighting conditions and the     processing power of the DIGIC 5+ processor also affords a wealth of     speed to all aspects of the camera, including a full-resolution     continuous shooting rate of 7 fps. Built-In Wireless Connectivity Integrated Wi-Fi enables remote control over the camera's     exposure settings (aperture, shutter speed, and ISO) as well as focus     and the shutter release from an iOS or Android mobile device when using     the Canon EOS Remote app. With this app, you can wireless control the     70D from a distance and utilize live view monitoring from your mobile     device for easier shooting from difficult angles and locations. Images     from the 70D can be backed-up to other wireless-enabled Canon cameras as     well as networked PCs and mobile devices for instant sharing via email     or to social networking and image hosting sites. Full DNLA (Digital     Living Network Alliance) compatibility also enables transferring of     files to other DNLA-compatible products like HDTVs and other wireless     devices for remote viewing and playback. When working from the camera     alone, files can also be transferred directly to the CANON iMAGE GATEWAY     for expedited sharing to social networking sites without the need of a     PC. PictBridge compatibility is also available and offers support for     wirelessly printing photos from the camera on a PictBridge-compatible     printer. When used in combination with the optional GP-E2 GPS Receiver,     geotagging and embedding of locational data into images' metadata is     possible for plotting imagery to maps and for recording the elevation,     direction, and Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) of each photograph. Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM Lens Included with the 70D is the EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM lens,     which provides a 35mm-equivalent focal length of 28.8-88mm. Covering a     range of perspectives from wide-angle to portrait-length, this lens is a     highly versatile tool for use in everyday situations for both still     image and movie recording. Its design integrates an STM stepping motor     that provides near-silent focusing abilities with smooth and precise     control. Additionally, the optical image stabilization system helps to     minimize the appearance of camera shake by up to four shutter speed     steps in order to benefit working in low-light conditions and with     greater zoom magnifications. One aspherical lens element is also     incorporated into the lens construction to help reduce chromatic     aberrations throughout the zoom range and an optimized lens coating has     been applied, too, in order to lessen lens flare and ghosting for higher     contrast, clearer imagery. EOS HD Video Full HD 1080p video recording is supported at 30, 24, and 25 fps     as well as HD and SD video recording in multiple frame rates. Video is     recorded using the high quality H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec and manual     exposure control is supported for greater refinement over the look and     feel of recordings. Video clips are automatically partitioned after the     file size has reached 4GB and both IPB and All i-frame compressions are     available for use depending on editing and output preferences. Sound can     be recorded using the built-in stereo microphone, or with an optional     external microphone using the 3.5mm microphone terminal, and controlled     manually across 64 levels. An attenuator function is also employed to     prevent audio clipping for cleaner overall sound. Movie Servo AF mode is available to provide continuous auto focusing     when recording video and pairs especially well when using an STM lens to     realize near-silent focusing during filming. Focusing is also heavily     benefited by the incorporation of the Dual Pixel CMOS AF system to     provide smooth, controllable focusing in live view with the added     benefit of the Touch AF function. The Video Snapshot mode can also be used to record short video clips, in     2, 4, or 8-second segments, and in-camera editing and music can be     applied to these files for finalized results straight from the camera. 3.0\" Clear View II LCD Monitor and Intelligent Viewfinder A large, bright 3.0\" 1,040k-dot vari-angle Clear View II     touchscreen LCD monitor is integrated into the 70D to enable clear live     view monitoring, image playback, and intuitive menu navigation. It's     vari-angle design aids in viewing from high and low angles and the     touchscreen control gives way to efficient navigation of menus and     shooting controls, as well as precise control over focus points. The     screen's construction incorporates an anti-reflective, smudge-resistant     coating to provide clearer viewing, even in bright, sunlit conditions. When working with still imagery and shooting at eye-level, an optical     pentaprism Intelligent Viewfinder is available and provides 98% frame     coverage. A superimposed LCD screen within the viewfinder provides     pertinent exposure and camera information for more efficient eye-level     shooting and also has the ability to outline AF points, grid lines, and     an electronic level to aid in composition. 19-Point All Cross-Type AF System When shooting with the optical viewfinder, a 19-point all     cross-type autofocus system is used to provide a wide range of focusing     coverage for acquiring focus accurately and quickly. The center point of     this cluster is a high-precision dual cross-type sensor that supports     focusing with f/2.8 and faster lenses in order to benefit focusing in     low-light conditions. These focus points are configurable and allow     homing in on specific elements within the frame to focus on, or,     alternatively, all can be used to provide coverage across the frame. iFCL 63-Zone Dual Layer Metering Sensor An intelligent metering system works in conjunction with the     autofocus system and independently analyzes focus, color, and luminance     within the scene for the most precise exposure settings possible. The 63     zones cover the entire image area with great detail and the dual-layer     design permits a wider sensitivity to different wavelengths of light.     The dual layers are split into a red/green channel and a blue/green     channel; which counters the red light sensitivity bias electronic     sensors inherently have. A series of algorithms are employed to combine     data received from both layers, with the resulting exposure reading     being extremely accurate regardless of the shooting conditions. This metering system employs evaluative, center-weighted, and spot     metering methods to determine exposure, as well as allowing for a +/- 5     EV exposure compensation for greater manipulation of the determined     exposure setting. Built-In HDR and Multiple Exposure Modes A High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode is available and allows for the     creation of HDR images in-camera, reducing the time needed to manually     overlay images in post-production. When using this mode, a series of     bracketed exposures are made of the same image, then automatically     composited, resulting in a photograph with controlled highlights,     detailed shadows, and a long middle range of tones. This mode is     especially useful when photographing scenes with a great deal of     contrast. Multiple exposures are also possible in-camera and up to 9 exposures can     be recorded onto a single file using two distinct settings for control.     When in Additive mode, this closely resembles making multiple exposures     on film and layers each exposure; manual exposure compensation is     required. Average mode layers the images and automatically compensates     for the final exposure, eliminating the unintended possibility of gross     under or overexposure. Multiple exposures can be recorded in either JPEG     or RAW formats, and furthermore you can utilize an existing RAW image     as a starting point from which to layer subsequent images, which can     then be manipulated in real time on the LCD. Scene Intelligent Auto and Special Scene Modes Scene Intelligent Auto mode incorporates a number of Canon's     automatic exposure technology together in order to output a well-refined     exposure. Picture Style Auto, Automatic Lighting Optimizer, Automatic     White Balance, Autofocus, and Automatic Exposure are all employed to     intelligently analyze the scene at hand and produce the most effective     exposure settings to clearly render your subject matter. Special Scene modes also help to enhance your imagery by applying a     system of corrections for use in more difficult lighting situations.     Handheld Night Scene automatically captures four consecutive exposures,     at shutter speeds fast enough to handhold, and layers them into a single     frame. This allows you to effectively record images in darker     situations without the need of a tripod or stabilization device. HDR     Backlight Control works in the same manner and records a series of     exposures at different values to ensure highlight and shadow values are     not lost. These under and over-exposed images are blended to create a     final image with a wider dynamic range. Other Camera Features Multi Shot Noise Reduction automatically composites four     sequential exposures together in order to gain one exposure that     exhibits minimal apparent noise. Peripheral illumination, chromatic aberration, and distortion     corrections are available and programmable through a menu of different     available EF lenses. This lens data is used to automatically correct for     each individual lens' traits to produce the cleanest image possible. Seven Creative Filters are available to aesthetically modify the     appearance of imagery in-camera, with the results visible in real time     when working in live view. These filters include Grainy Black and White,     Soft Focus, Fisheye Effect, Toy Camera Effect, Miniature Effect, Art     Bold Effect, and Water Painting Effect. Compatible with SD, SDHC, and SDXC, including Ultra High Speed (UHS-I), memory cards. Compatible with eTTL II flash metering for use with compatible external flash units. A built-in pop-up flash is available to provide additional illumination to scenes. Silent shooting is a low-vibration shooting mode that slows and     mutes the shutter and mirror reflex, enabling a more discrete method of     capturing imagery. In-camera RAW processing allows for the converting of RAW image     files to JPEGs without the need for a computer. When using this     function, 10 process variables-brightness adjustment, white balance,     Picture Style, Auto Lighting Optimizer, noise reduction, JPEG     image-recording quality, color space, lens peripheral illumination     correction, distortion correction, and chromatic aberration     correction-are available for fine-tuning the appearance of photos. A Feature Guide can be employed to help explain and the specific     functions of each dedicated camera control to help for properly applying     a variety of settings while shooting.
