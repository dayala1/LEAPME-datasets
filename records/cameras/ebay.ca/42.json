Scene Intelligent Auto Scene Intelligent Auto mode incorporates a number of Canon     technologies to deliver the best possible exposure. Joining Picture     Style Auto, Automatic Lighting Optimizer, Automatic White Balance,     Autofocus, and Automatic Exposure, Scene Intelligent Auto mode analyzes     the image, accounting for faces, colors, brightness, moving objects,     contrast, even whether the camera is handheld or on a tripod, and then     chooses the exposure and enhancements that bring out the best in any     scene or situation. Advanced Image Features Handheld Night Scene mode makes it easy to shoot difficult night     scenes without blur. By shooting and combining four consecutive shots     at a shutter speed fast enough to avoid camera shake, Handheld Night     Scene mode makes dramatic nighttime photography simple.

The EOS     Rebel T5i's Peripheral Illumination Correction feature corrects light     falloff in the corner of the image according to the characteristics of     the lens being used. It even has correction data for a number of popular     lenses stored in its memory. With the EOS Rebel T5i's chromatic     aberration correction tool, distracting color fringing can be corrected     at the time of shooting. Creative Filters Seven Creative Filters add expressive touches to your images and     can be seen in real time when shooting in Live View. Creative Filters     include Grainy Black and White, Soft Focus, Fisheye Effect, Toy Camera     Effect, Miniature Effect, Art Bold Effect and Water Painting Effect.     Each effect can be applied in three different levels (low, standard and     strong).

It features a focal length range of 18-55mm (35mm equivalent: 28.8-88mm) and an Optical Image Stabilizer providing the equivalent of up to four stops of shake correction. A high-precision aspherical element reduces chromatic aberration throughout the zoom range for high resolution and contrast. The lens supports Canon's EOS Movie Servo AF feature for smooth and quiet continuous autofocusing during movie recording. This feature is enabled by the use of a six-group zoom system plus a stepping motor focusing mechanism. Additionally, manual focus adjustment is possible while shooting in AF mode, and an internal focusing system maintains an overall compact lens form-factor, enables faster performance, and allows for a closer minimum focusing distance of 0.82'. The front element of the lens does not rotate during focusing, allowing you to use polarizing filters without a problem. Optimized lens coatings ensure precise color balance while minimizing ghosting and flare, and the 7-blade circular diaphragm produces pleasing background blur.
