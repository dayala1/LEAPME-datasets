The possibilities are endless. ISO 50-409600 in expanded mode (200-409600 in movie mode) XGA OLED viewfinder BIONZ X processor no optical low pass filter 12.2MP full-frame Exmor\u00c2\u00ae CMOS sensor The worlds first full frame 4K camera Shoot as you see with fast AF & an XGA OLED viewfinder Stunning low-light performance as low as EV-4 Joining the already sucessful a7 line-up, the a7S is the first full-frame 4K camera, offering stunning low-light performance as well as sensitivity of up to ISO 409600 all wrapped up in a compact body allowing your creativity to be truly mobile. Full Details Standard ISO range: Still 100 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 102400, Movie 200-102400. Expandable ISO range: Still 50-409600, Movie 200-409600 From starry night-time skies to atmospheric, candle-lit interiors: there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now a camera that opens up extraordinary creative possibilities for capturing flawless, emotionally engaging movie footage and professional-quality still images. Joining the acclaimed \u00ce\u00b17 and \u00ce\u00b17R \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smallest[1] full-frame interchangeable lens cameras \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the \u00ce\u00b17S from Sony puts extraordinary sensitivity, low noise and spectacular 4K (QFHD: 3840\u00c3\u00972160) image quality into the hands of serious photographers and videographers. Equally suitable for still photography and cost-conscious movie production, the \u00ce\u00b17S delivers dramatic artistic possibilities in the smallest body of any full-frame interchangeable-lens digital camera in the world. Key to the extraordinary sensitivity of the \u00ce\u00b17S is a specially developed new full-frame 35mm Exmor CMOS image sensor. With a 12.2 effective megapixel count the size of each individual photoreceptive site is significantly boosted to increase their light-gathering power. Coupled with the camera\u00e2\u0080\u0099s powerful BIONZ X processing engine, this reduces image noise while increasing effective sensitivity range of the \u00ce\u00b17S to ISO 50 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 ISO 409600 in expanded mode (ISO 200 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 409600 for movies). This unrivalled sensitivity and ultra-low noise floor allows the \u00ce\u00b17S to capture beautiful images in low light conditions where a lengthy exposure would normally be needed. Thanks to the camera\u00e2\u0080\u0099s huge sensitivity, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to shoot crisp, low-noise stills and video using faster shutter speeds. Its immense dynamic range is also ideal for high-contrast scenes, effortlessly handling extreme highlights and rich, deep blacks in the same frame. Because of the image sensor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extraordinary sensitivity, the amount of light it can collect is dramatically increased compared with conventional cameras. The newly developed image sensor provides photographers/videographers with high dynamic range in all conditions from extremely low light to bright sunlight. Using data read-out from every single pixel of the 35mm full-frame sensor (24p and 25p), 4K[2] images created by the \u00ce\u00b17S are impressively detailed, with outstandingly rich colours and life-like textures in every frame. Refined by the BIONZ X processor, the high-speed data stream allows the \u00ce\u00b17S to output video at 4K resolution from the HDMI connector with 4:2:2 colour sampling, for recording onto an external storage device or viewing on a compatible monitor[3]. Thanks to the full pixel read-out from the whole of the 35mm full-frame sensor, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a notable absence of undesirable aliasing (moir\u00c3\u00a9) effects and \u00e2\u0080\u0098jaggies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that betray lower-resolution video. Stunningly clear images can be recorded on a memory card in Full HD quality with XAVC S[4] recording format at the 50Mbps data rate that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highly regarded by professional videographers. In APS-C crop mode, the \u00ce\u00b17S supports high frame rate shooting at 120fps or 100fps with HD resolution (1280 x 720 pixels). The 120fps footage can be played back at 24p for a 5x slow-motion effect \u00e2\u0080\u0093 ideal for seeing every detail of sports action or the balletic grace of a dancer. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a wealth of other specialist functions to please professional videographers such as Picture Profile\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 for wide ranging visual expression and S-Log2 gamma. Time code/user bit functions allow pro-style editing workflow, while an optional XLR Adaptor Microphone Kit[5] supports high-quality audio acquisition. As already proven on the \u00ce\u00b17R, high-speed, high-precision Fast Intelligent AF has been further improved to fully exploit the new camera\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extraordinary low-light performance as low as EV-4. Other features familiar to \u00ce\u00b17 users include a high-contrast XGA OLED Tru-Finder, Wi-Fi/NFC connectivity and compatibility with the growing range of downloadable PlayMemories Camera Apps.
