Now the 5D Mark III is here, and although it looks great on   the outside, there have been significant improvements to the   interior. The twins are the flagship features 22 megapixel CMOS sensor   full frame, and the ability to record video at 1080p HD. Other new and   improved features include a 61-point autofocus system, metering system   63-zone, enhanced sealing time, an ISO range of 50 to 102.400, high-rate   video compression options, large 3.2-inch LCD dual CF and SD memory   card slots and shooting continuously at 6 frames per second. 22.3 megapixel CMOS sensor full frame The EOS 5D Mark III has a full-frame Canon CMOS   sensor newly developed 22.3 million pixel that is designed from scratch   to create high resolution, perfectly detailed with a speed and   unprecedented clarity images. A full 24 x 36 mm, the sensor captures   5784 x 3861 large individual 6.25 micron pixels and has a much improved S   / N resulting in better images from the start.
