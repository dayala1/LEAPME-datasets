    "feature": "World's Smallest and Lightest Meet the world's smallest and lightest interchangeable lens full-frame camera*. Sony's Exmor\u00ae image sensor takes full advantage of the Full-frame format, but in a camera body less than half the size and weight of a full-frame DSLR. Ultimate Full Frame Resolution Capture unbelievably high resolution in combination with high sensitivity and extremely low noise thanks to a newly developed 36.4MP 35mm full-frame Exmor CMOS sensor. Removing the optical low-pass filter brings out the full potential of the sensor and lens, enhancing the sense of clarity with supremely realistic details to the very edges of your photos. An AR coating also reduces flare and ghosting. New BIONZ X Image Processing Engine Sony proudly introduces the new BIONZ\u00ae X image processing engine, which faithfully reproduces textures and details in real time, as seen by the naked eye, via extra high-speed processing capabilities. Together with front-end LSI (large scale integration) that accelerates processing in the earliest stages, it enables more natural details, more realistic images, richer tonal gradations and lower noise whether you shoot still images or movies. Eye Catching Capture subjects partially turned away from the camera in a shallow depth of field with no problem thanks to Eye AF. Simply focus on a face, and a green frame appears over the prioritized eye to confirm the proper subject is locked. Its extremely accurate eye detection can even prioritize a single pupil. Eye AF can be used when the function is assigned to a customizable button, allowing users to instantly activate it depending on the scene. Optimal Optics To take advantage of the lightweight on-the-go body, the a7R is fully compatible with Sony's E-mount lens system as well as compact and lightweight E-mount full-frame lenses from Carl Zeiss\u00ae and Sony's premier G-Series. Fast and Intuitive Shooting Control Respond swiftly with just the right settings without searching through dedicated menus thanks to Quick Navi Pro. Easily view all major shooting options on the LCD screen so you can rapidly confirm settings and make adjustments on the fly when fleeting shooting opportunities arise. PlayMemories Camera Apps The exciting new application download service, PlayMemories\u2122Camera Apps, lets you add new functions to your camera's existing feature-set to heighten photographic expression according to your own creative needs. Two applications are currently available for a7R as of October 16, 2013: Direct Upload uploads photos directly to networking services and Smart Remote Control allows a smartphone to control the camera. Many more apps will become available later, including Multiple Exposure, Lens Compensation, Photo Retouch and Picture Effect+.",
