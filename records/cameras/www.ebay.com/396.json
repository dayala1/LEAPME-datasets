Part: DSC-RX10/B Item Includes Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-RX10 Digital Camera - Rechargeable Battery Pack NP-FW50 - AC Adaptor AC-UB10 - Micro USB Cable - Shoulder Strap - Lens Cap - Shoe Cap - Lens Hood - Eyepiece Cup - Software - Sony 1 Year Warranty Description The Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-RX10 has plenty of features to realize more of the potential in your movies. To record sound with precision worthy of professional production, connect a high-performance microphone through an input terminal. Monitor pristine stereo sound through premium-quality Sony headphones plugged into the headphone jack. A built-in HDMI output terminal also accommodates connection of a TV, computer or DVD player/recorder. Audio metering and recording level control are instrumental to keeping soundtracks smooth and consistent. Use the camera's Multi Interface Shoe and an optional XLR Adaptor Kit to hook up external recording, flash and other accessories. It all adds up to a set of professional-class capabilities that is unprecedented among all other compact cameras. Containing back-illuminated technology and approximately 4x larger light-sensitive area that other compact DSC (digital still cameras) can't match, Sony's 20.2-megapixel 1.0-inch Exmor R CMOS sensor harnesses light and reduces image noise very efficiently. This, along with high settings of a wide ISO range, allow even photos of dimly lit scenes to look incredibly clear. Features With the new RX10 - the compact digital camera that puts boundless picture-taking power in your hands and a fresh new outlook in your sights A large F2.8 maximum aperture throughout an expansive 24-200mm (35mm equivalent) zoom range gives you ample opportunity to express your vision. Make a subject stand out - manipulate depth of field to defocus backgrounds for creative effect, as great photographers do Close-up shooting is seamless. No switching to macro mode is needed. Zoom in all the way up to extreme telephoto on a subject as near as 11-inches (30cm) away. The built-in lens makes it more convenient for you to take impressive shots throughout a big range An advanced aspherical lens (AA lens) reduces diameter and length and maintains high resolution even at image edges. A new Direct Drive SSM (Super Sonicwave Motor) stops lens movement with spot-on precision. Far-reaching optical flexibility minimizes mechanical dimensions The groundbreaking new BIONZ X image processing engine not only maximizes picture quality in ways that only a seamlessly unified body and lens design can realize - it also faithfully reproduces textures and details in real time, as seen by the naked eye, with peerless high-speed processing By minimizing digital artifacts that tend to overemphasize hard outlines and rough edges when pictures are reproduced, detail reproduction technology makes images noticeably more lifelike, clean and natural-looking in every detail, texture and dimension Now, noise reduction is individually adjusted based on imaging pattern variations, for superior clarity and finer details throughout even images shot in low light High-speed AF is remarkably smooth thanks to the Direct Drive SSM (Super Sonicwave Motor) with precision-engineered focusing stop positions designed to minimize focusing lens travel distance, which shortens focusing time Choose among three concentric Flexible Spot frames for greater focusing versatility and precision than other cameras' fixed-focus spot frame systems can provide Just press the shutter button halfway to activate Lock-on AF. It precisely focuses even on moving subjects by continuously adjusting target frame size based on its recognition of subject characteristics Applying advanced detection technology, this new Eye AF function detects and focuses on a subject's eye, even if the subject is facing or looking slightly away from the camera An abundance of powerful higher-performance functions and options are invaluable for capturing moving images of superior resolution and stunning clarity with minimal noise, even while zooming on the action As Full High Definition (Full HD) movie recording has become a standard of high-performance video recording and playback, Sony advances better ways to take advantage of its potential Clear, uncompressed digital movie signal output can be transferred to an external monitor/recorder (connected via the HDMI terminal) simultaneously in real time from the RX10. The shooting info display can be turned off for even cleaner views of such movies on an external monitor/recorder See spectacular clarity, contrast and detail in every scene, regardless of conditions, on the built-in, bright, high-resolution OLED Tru-Finder. Four dual-sided aspherical lenses provide a big, approx. 33-degree view angle and maintain excellent edge-to-edge visibility of the electronic viewfinder For faster, more intuitive camera operation, you can customize a total of seven buttons by assigning up to 40 types of functions among them. As a result, you will gain more convenient access to your selection of frequently used functions, right at your fingertips Magnesium alloy top and front casings make the RX10 light, solid and robust enough for long, rigorous use by advanced photographers and videographers. The camera's dust- and moisture-resistant design even allows shooting in rugged outdoor environments A new, improved graphical user interface makes access to frequently used functions absolutely effortless. Just press the Fn button to display a list of them An approximately 1,229K-dot tiltable 3.0-inch White Magic LCD lets you shoot comfortably from various positions. The display has the flexibility to be tilted within a range of angles extending from about 84 degrees upward to about 45 degrees downward Just download the free PlayMemories Mobile app, then instantly connect via Wi-Fi or NFC (near field communication) by touching a compatible Android smartphone or tablet to the camera This free, easy-to-use image management software can be installed onto Windows and Mac computers, for downloading photos and movies which can then be viewed, organized, edited, retouched, printed, burned to disk, shared or uploaded to social networking websites Virtually relive moments when you witnessed such nuances as the shades of a shimmering blue sky or a rosy complexion.
