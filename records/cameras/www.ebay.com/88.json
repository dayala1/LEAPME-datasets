The Nikon SB 28 has a more compact design than most full-size Nikon flashes but does not lack for powerful. This shoe mount flash only weighs about 11 oz, nearly 30 percent less than its predecessors (SB 24, SB 25, and SB 26). This Nikon Speedlight flash offers wide compatibility and works seamlessly on all Nikon SLR cameras. The Nikon SB 28 displays a flat panel design, with a clean and uncomplicated rear section where the luminous LCD screen and control buttons are located. The liquid crystal display shows a complete list of basic information, such as zoom setting, aperture, film speed, flash modes, version of TTL, and distance range of flash output. This shoe mount flash uses standard AA Alkaline or Lithium (KR-6) batteries and also accepts variable external power sources to allow extended shooting during a long session. The integrated wide adapter of the Nikon Speedlight flash enables this useful tool to reach a coverage that spreads down to a 0.7-inch (18-mm) ultra wide-angle lens.
