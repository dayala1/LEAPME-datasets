    "features": "Give your photographic passions an adrenaline injection with the exceptionally powerful D7100. Surprisingly light and compact for a feature-packed and durable body, it delivers superior DX performance to take your photography to the next level. By not employing an optical low pass filter (OLPF), the D7100 makes the most of its 24.1-megapixel DX-format CMOS sensor to sharply capture even the finest textures in crisp high resolution. Its 51-point autofocus (AF) system offers you rapid and ultra accurate image capture at professional level. Weather and dust resistant, with magnesium alloy top and rear covers, this high-spec D-SLR shoots continuously at 6 fps, gives an extra telephoto effect with innovative 1.3x crop function and has ISO sensitivity of 100-6400, bringing superb results in poorly-lit environments or fast-moving action. Shoot with viewfinder or Live View, apply special effects in real time for stills or Full HD movies, and send images wirelessly* to your smart device for sharing on social media \u2013 the D7100 puts exceptional control in your hands, wherever you go, whatever you do.",
