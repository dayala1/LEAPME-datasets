Packing a 18x zoom lens into an incredibly slim body, the versatile Coolpix S9400 offers wide-angle to super-telephoto coverage (25-450mm 35mm equivalent), while the camera\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compact dimensions make it ideal for carrying around. No matter what kind of light you shoot under, the highly sensitive 18MP back illuminated CMOS image sensor captures scenes just as you see them. Lens-Shift Vibration Reduction ensures sharp photos and movies, even when shooting at the telephoto end of the zoom, making the Nikon Coolpix S9400 a slim super-zoom camera for superior images in any situation. The Coolpix S9400 offers full HD 1080p recording, Auto HDR mode, 3D shooting mode, Easy Panorama, 19 scene modes and a large 3.0\u00e2\u0080\u009d OLED screen that offers excellent visibility, even in direct sunlight. Nikon Coolpix Digital Camera Super zoom: the 18x NIKKOR wide-angle optical zoom lens (25\u00e2\u0080\u0093450 mm) with ED glass will make you a sharp shooter from virtually any distance. Back-illuminated 18 MP CMOS sensor: with each pixel receiving more light, this highly sensitive image sensor works with the EXPEED C2 processor to deliver clear shots in any light. 7.5-cm (3.0-in.) 614k-dot OLED screen: with superior brightness and impressive colour rendering, thanks to OLED technology, this large screen offers excellent visibility and sharp contrast in all light conditions, including direct sunlight. Lens-shift VR (vibration reduction): capture steady photos and movies thanks to Nikon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automatic vibration reduction technology, which counters the effects of camera shake in real time. Full HD (1080p) movie recording: easily record life in motion and in stereo sound. A dedicated video-record button makes it easy to begin filming. Advanced movie functions: if you pause and then continue filming, the camera will create a single movie file for smooth playback. The optical zoom with autofocus can be used when filming and you can record in iFrame format. Connect the camera directly to an HDTV using the built-in HDMI connector. Auto HDR mode: capture images with impressive tonal detail in any situation when you shoot in HDR mode. The camera combines two shots taken at different exposures during a single shutter release to create an image with wide dynamic range and rich colour gradation. Smart portrait system: snap perfect portraits every time. Smile timer takes the shot when your subject smiles, Blink proof alerts you when someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes were closed, and Glamour retouch options help you make portraits look more flattering. Easy Panorama 360\u00c2\u00b0/180\u00c2\u00b0: pan vertically or horizontally to create dynamic panoramas. 3D shooting mode: create 3D images that can be displayed on 3D-capable TVs and computers. Retouch menu: enhance your photos on the spot with a wide range of filter effects, including quick effect mode in playback. Examples include Selective Colour, which converts your image to monochrome and then adds a splash of colour to the area of your choice, while Cross Screen adds a starry effect to bright objects. High-speed continuous shooting: capture sharp shots of the action with ease. The camera can shoot up to 5 frames at a fast 7.5 fps. Mode dial: access the most important shooting modes quickly and easily via the conveniently placed mode dial. 19 scene modes: scene modes automatically optimize the camera settings for popular photographic styles, effects and locations. Achieve great shots just by selecting the mode that matches your situation. Fast and accurate AF: when you want to capture complex subjects, you can shoot in manual focus with a 99-point autofocus system for extra-sharp results. Subject Tracking AF: capture sharp shots of subjects on the move. Subject Tracking AF keeps the camera focused on a selected subject even if it refuses to stay still. Wireless transfer: compatible with Eye-Fi X2 (or later) cards. Transmit your digital photos (in JPEG format) directly to your smart device or computer, and then go online to take advantage of Nikon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photo sharing service, my Picturetown.
