Technical Details: Brand Name: Crayola Model: 24073-PDQ Optical Sensor Resolution: 2.1 MP Optical zoom: 2.5 x Display Size: 3.6cm Product Description: Entertain your little photographer with this Crayola 2.1 MP Camera. The built-in memory takes over 120 photos, the camera buttons are coloured, and straightforward, and the camera has both a viewfinder and a LCD screen. The software that comes with the camera, called Colour Genie, is more than just photo editing software in that it is also kid-friendly. It is also compatible with both PC and Mac computers. The photo editing and project creation isn't just a step for parents to do, but it is meant for children to be involved and learn the computer side of digital photography. They can express their photography and art the way they see it. If your child is beginning to learn to operate a computer, or if you are looking at ways to teach them, this camera in combination with the Colour Genie software is a great learning tool. You just upload pictures from the camera onto your computer using a USB cable and Colour Genie software. This product contains small parts and is a choking hazard so not suitable for children under 3 years old. Publisher: Crayola Dimensions: 19.3 x 8.6 x 23.4 centimetres (0.45 kg) Age Range: 5-9 years",
