    "marketinginformation": "Featuring a 73\u00b0 horizontal wide-angle lens. This provides a wider monitoring range without having to move the camera. Camera simultaneously sends MPEG-4 images in three resolutions (VGA, QVGA, and SCIF), and JPEG images in the same three resolutions in favour motion, standard, and favour clarity image-quality types. MPEG-4 is recommended for viewing smooth motion images, and JPEG is recommended for recording higher quality images."
