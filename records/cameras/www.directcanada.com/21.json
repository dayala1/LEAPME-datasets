    "marketinginformation": "Power over Ethernet (PoE) offers an easy, fast and cost-effective solution for supplying power to network video products without the need to install power outlets and electrical cabling. Simply connect the Axis PoE midspans and PoE splitters to the network, and the network video products are supplied with power. Axis PoE midspans provide power (max. 15.4 W per port) over Ethernet cables to network video products with built-in PoE support. For a network video product without built-in PoE support, a PoE splitter must be used to separate power and data coming over the network cable."
