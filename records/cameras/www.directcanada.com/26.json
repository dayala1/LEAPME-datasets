    "marketinginformation": "24/7 HD Surveillance for Your Home or Office The DCS-7010L is built with a megapixel image sensor to give you high-quality snapshots and video with resolutions up to 720p HD. This gives you sharp, high-resolution snapshots and videos with rich detail. Get a closer look with ePTZ, which lets you zoom in, zoom out, and pan across your camera's video so you can survey a large area easily. An infrared cut removable (ICR) filter is also built into the DCS-7010L, which blocks infrared light during the day for improved image quality. At night, it moves out of the way to use all available light for low-light surveillance, and paired with a powerful IR LED illuminator with a 10 meter range, this camera can monitor an area even in complete darkness."
